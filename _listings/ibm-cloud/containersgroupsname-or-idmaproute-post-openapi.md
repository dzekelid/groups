  title: IBM Containers Map a public route to a container group.
  description: 'If you want your container group to be accessible from the Internet,
    you need to expose a public port and map a public route to it (corresponding IBM
    Containers command: `cf ic route map -n <host> -d <domain> <group>`). Every route
    consists of the host name and domain.'

      summary: Create and start a container group.
      description: "This endpoint creates and starts a new container group in your
        space. A container group consists of two or more single containers that are
        all created from the same container image and as a consequence are configured
        in the same way. Container groups offer different options at no cost to make
        your app highly available, such as in-built load balancing, auto-recovery
        of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling of container instances
        based on CPU and memory usage.\n\nTo create a container group with IBM Containers,
        you must at least define a container group name and the image that the container
        group is based on. Required attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-
        Name: The container group name must start with a letter and then can include
        uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), underscores (_),
        or hyphens (-). \n- Image: You must include the full path to the image in
        your private Bluemix registry in the format:`registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/<image>`."
